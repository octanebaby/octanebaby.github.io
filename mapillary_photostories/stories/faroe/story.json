  "intro": "My son Oskar wanted a road trip for our holiday week this year. We were thinking to go to Norway, but then we read about the Faroe Islands' petition to get a street view, and the Sheep View project. How cool - we are in! I booked the tickets the day after we read the article, and the following week we set off to capture as much of the Faroe Islands as possible. Now everyone can explore this magnificent place!",

      "description": "Fámjin - a picturesque village on Suðuroy, the southernmost island of the Faroe Islands. According to legend, it used to be called Vesturvik. One day, two fishermen from the village noticed a French sailship waiting for wind nearby. They managed to invite two ladies from the ship into their boat with the excuse to see a large flatfish. As the ladies got on the boat, the fishermen quickly rowed away with them, with the Frenchmen shouting after them - Femmes! Femmes! Since that day, Vesturvik is called Fámjin."

An interesting thing about them is that after the breeding season they shed the colorful part of their beaks, leaving a much smaller and more inconspicuous beak instead."

The island has no roads, and the village itself has no streets. The few inhabitants get around mostly on foot, and hence the network of footpaths is very well developed there."

The islands consist of three layers of basalt - a rock formed when lava cools down quickly - which were formed some 54 to 58 million years ago in the active volcanic region that today is found around Iceland and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge."
