We’ll leave coverage of the blood, sweat and tears to the professionals, but we thought we’d take this opportunity to highlight the photo mapping that has been taking place in Rio.",

      "description": "Rio de Janeiro is a city that has been undergoing significant change. Economic growth, the expectations of citizens and the requirements of the World Cup and the Olympics have prompted a rethink and a massive redevelopment of the city&#8217s infrastructure. Subways have been built, favela&#8217s transformed, light rail and bus lines added to the mix and of course sprawling sports complexes constructed. Ideally this will result in a safer, more sustainable and better connected city. The reality is that each of these changes have both positive and detrimental impacts on citizens as competing interests are managed.Pedestrians, cyclists, car owners, business owners and even the government must each communicate their positions and approach policy discussion from an informed perspective. Mapillary allows each of these groups to create a visual representation of their city - accessible to anyone with a smartphone, simple to use, with powerful analysis behind every photo. Of course these stakeholders are not mutually exclusive, and citizens can be equally concerned about cycling infrastructure as they are about reducing traffic congestion. Here are some of our favorite sequences from Rio, courtesy of contributors <a href=\"https://www.mapillary.com/profile/nighto\"> Nighto </a> and <a href=\"https://www.mapillary.com/profile/trilhosdorio\">Trilhosdorio</a>."

Just as important however are footpaths and cycling lanes that often don't have powerful lobby groups demanding their construction. Groups intestested in sustainable transport have have been using Mapillary map newly constructed routes and show where additional routes are needed."

      "description": "We’ve already added support for Brazilian traffic sign detection and are developing better optical character recognition and semantic detection to automatically detect objects of interest. This means that on every image we’ll be detecting trees, cars, pedestrians, cyclists and a growing list of objects. <br>Using readily accessible equipment, Carioca’s (citizens of Rio) are documenting how the city changes over time. This is a real opportunity for government and constituents to work together to build a world class city that moves with the time. The lasting legacy of the Olympics on a city is determined by the infrastructure left behind and whether it still serves a purpose when the final medals have been awarded.<br><br>We hope you enjoyed this exploration of Rio and if you’re at the games, make sure to take some photos."
