Last week, I was making my way back to my hotel in San Francisco, when some one jumped me and tried to grab my bag.   I struggled (and screamed, a lot) for a minute and then the person got off me and ran away.  My glasses had gotten flung off and bent during the scuffle, but otherwise I was and am 100% ok.

The only thing I’ve lost is the sense of being invincible.  I love cities and I love walking in them.  On foot, my favorite cities unfold like [Ellen Page’s imagination in *Inception*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3tBBhYJeAw) and I feel like each neighborhood, each block, each store and each person is new, even if it’s the opposite of.  Some blocks are less shiny than others.  Before last week, I thought: I’m not exactly posh myself, just be smart, stay alert and it’ll be fine. 

In recounting this story, furrowed brows consistently clear up as soon as I mention that I was walking in the Tenderloin.  (“Where?! Hyde Street…ah.”).  Before last week, I was the San Francisco Tenderloin evangelist.  It’s cheap.  Great food.  Beautiful architecture.  Just don’t fuck with the crackheads and they won’t fuck with you. 

I hate, hate, hate being proven wrong on this.  

I’m not unduly traumatized (not dead, injured or raped after all) but the truth is: I’m a bit less confident and a bit more afraid.  In retrospect, I don’t think the guy was out to hurt me, but in the moment I was scared out of my mind. There was no thought in my head, no life-flashing-before-my-eyes, no way (despite supportive suggestions from friends the next day) I would have had the presence of mind to pepper spray or knife or key anyone.  

The next day instead of heading out when it was just getting light, I waited till more people filled out the streets.  A shabbily-dressed man greeted me cheerfully and I turned away. Next week I’m heading to San Francisco again and I’ve booked a room in a “nicer” part of town for 3x the price. I won’t venture out to the Tenderloin again on my own, not even to get the [best sandwich in the city](http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco).  I’ll likely say “yes, please” when a Man offers to walk me home. 

What’s behind all this is that I can’t think of anything I did stupidly other than *be* there.  It was just after 7 pm and the street was well lit.   I made sure that I was on streets where there were other people.  When I was knocked down, half a dozen people were in a 10 foot radius; over the guy’s shoulder I could see two standing around like they didn’t see.  When it was over, no one responded to my begging for help to find my glasses until a shopkeeper who had heard me screaming came running.  

That good and decent man found them for me and walked me back to my hotel.  And here I am, 100% ok and happy about it.  

But not invincible.  I won’t walk the city — any city — the same way again.
