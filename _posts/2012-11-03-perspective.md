It’s been quite a month: 

<ol>
<li>I was mugged, almost</li>
<li>An ex-colleague faced a parent’s worst nightmare</li>
<li>Sandy</li>
</ol>

I haven’t been dealt the worst hand in any of these situations, not by a long shot.  I wasn’t hurt in #1.  The heartsickness I feel about #2 is a drop in the ocean compared to the grief my old friend is dealing with.  During #3, my apartment went dark but I had food, water and good company.   Now everything is back to normal.

Or is it?  This week I found myself cutting out everything but what I care most about as I scrabbled for vestiges of power and connectivity.  I also rediscovered things I used to do — happily — before I wallowed in stuff I take for granted today:

<ul>
<li>taking a bath out of a tub with a bucket</li>
<li>reading fiction</li>
<li>figuring out how to play songs by ear (look ma, no tabs!)</li>
<li>talking to neighbors</li>
</ul>

There are plenty of stories about people having life-altering experiences and redefining their priorities.  These stories are probably all better than my non-events and new collection of simple joys.   But still — this month has shown me, and I will not be the same again.
