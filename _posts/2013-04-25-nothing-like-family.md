**Jackie:** Hey, your intern wrote a really nice blog about you before he left your company.

**Me:**  He wasn't an intern.

**Jackie:** Eh? Not an intern?

**Me:** Nope. Full-time employee.

**Jackie:** Oh.

**Jackie:** And he quit anyway?

**Me:** Yes.

**Jackie:** Doesn't say much about you, does it.
