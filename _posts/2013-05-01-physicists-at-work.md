Today some one remarked that of all our open reqs, our Applied Data Scientist job is getting far and away the most interest. And application after application -- physicist, physicist, astrophysicist, physicist...

I love working in tech and I believe that a lot of what we do as an industry is Important.  I know academia is a [long and winding road](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/the-phd-bust-americas-awful-market-for-young-scientists-in-7-charts/273339/) with pockets of paralyzing despair and uncertainty.  I'd bet lots of academics would be (or already are) happy working in industry.  I think everyone deserves to be happy.

But I hope there are enough happy physicists left to solve the mysteries of the universe.
