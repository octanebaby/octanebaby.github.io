Sakura Express is a little sushi shop on Witherspoon Street in Princeton NJ.  I ate there at least twice a month when I was an independent upperclassman.  Back then, the proprietors were Albert and Andrew - a gruff pair, with soft marshmallowy centers.  If you were a regular it was unusual not to get a little something extra on your plate (some salmon skin! a pile of spicy tuna! a handroll!).

I stopped in a couple of times after I graduated but the last time was probably over eight years ago.  I heard one of them got married and left. I've eaten a lot more sushi in New York and San Francisco since. 

Last night I happened to be in Princeton and thought I'd have me some tasty sushi. I walked in and saw him, behind the counter like always, slicing some octopus:

**Me**: Albert?

**Him**:  Nope. It's Andrew.  Hey, Malaysia.

That's Andrew, and yes, he is giving me the bird. 

Some of this is, of course,  due to how incredibly well-preserved I am. But still, what a memory! How many Princeton kids has Andrew fed over the years? How many does he remember? How many remember him? 

Ziggy and I ate our sushi next to a wall plastered  with postcards from well-wishers from all over the world.  That's some legacy.
